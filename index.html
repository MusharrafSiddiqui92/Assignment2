        <dt>Rabri</dt>
        <dd>Rabri is a traditional North Indian sweet dish made from milk. Itâ€™s thick, creamy, and flavored with
            cardamom, saffron, and sometimes garnished with nuts like almonds and pistachios. Here's how it's typically
            prepared:</dd>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 liter full-fat milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>4-5 cardamom pods</li>
            <li>A few saffron strands </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the Milk: Pour the milk into a wide, heavy-bottomed pan and bring it to a boil over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>Reduce the Milk: Once it boils, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer. Stir occasionally to prevent
                it from sticking to the bottom. Scrape the sides of the pan and add the cream layer back into the milk
                as it forms.</li>
            <li>Add Sugar and Flavors: When the milk reduces to about a third of its original volume, add sugar, crushed
                cardamom, and saffron strands (if using).</li>
            <li>Cook Further: Continue to simmer for another 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend and the milk
                to thicken further.</li>
            <li>Garnish: Once the desired consistency is achieved, turn off the heat and let the rabri cool. Garnish
                with chopped nuts.</li>
            <li>Serve: Rabri can be served warm or chilled. It pairs well with sweets like malpua or jalebi.</li>
        </ol>
